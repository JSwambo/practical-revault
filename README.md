# Practical revault

A specification for the initialization and operation of the [Revault](revault.pdf) custody protocol.


This repo is for us to bikeshed on the actual and practical architecture before
moving forward with the implementation.

Anyone is welcome to contribute by raising issues for either asking questions
about, or pointing out actual issues with the protocol.
